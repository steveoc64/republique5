French Order of Battle for the Waterloo Campaign

This order of battle is for all French forces as of June 18th, the day of the twin battles of Wavre and Waterloo. Losses for the earlier battles at Ligny and Quatre Bras were approximately 15 and 8 bases of troops respectively. However, some of these may have already returned to the ranks by the time of June 18, so any re-creation of the June 16 battles would need to add only a portion (maybe 30%) of the "lost" bases.

All French line infantry for the battle can be treated as average. Due to their small size by this point in the campaign, virtually all French infantry regiments have been converged into their respective brigades, and many cavalry brigades have been converged into their parent divisions. For skirmish base allotments, continue to refer to the Troop Lists section of the Republique rules. Infantry brigades which contain both light and line units may deploy skirmish markers from half of bases present.

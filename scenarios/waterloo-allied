Anglo-Dutch Order or Battle for the Waterloo Campaign

Where unit performance is known or can be inferred, values have been given. The British commander will probably want to assign some of the various light cavalry brigades from the reserve to the line divisions, thereby leaving Uxbridge with a more maneuverable command of four or five brigades. Losses at Quatre Bras (fought before Waterloo) were about four bases of British (lost from 1st and 5th divisions), two bases of Brunswickers and two bases of Dutch.

During the battle at Waterloo, small British detachments of elite and veteran troops were able to occupy and hold some key forward strongpoints against what might seem long odds. From a game mechanics perspective, this was possible due to several crucial details: The strongpoints at La Haye Sainte and Hougomont both had small patches of orchards and woods on the southern edges of the properties, thereby protecting their occupants from the fire of those French artillery batteries closest to them; their flanks were closely supported by British artillery, thereby preventing the complete surrounding of the garrisons; both sites were on different levels than the very few French artillery batteries which could bear at longer ranges. The positions were very well protected, and both La Haye Sainte and Hougomont are class A defenses.

La Haye Sainte should be about one inch square, with a one inch wide, two inch long strip of orchard to its south. The Hougomont enclosure should be about six inches square, with the main building being about a two by three inch rectangle at the north end of the square wooded area. The sand pit to the north of La Haye Sainte should probably be solid cover, and only just big enough to offer cover to one base.

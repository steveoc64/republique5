FRENCH ARMY : NOTES - Most French troops will be average quality, with some rated as green, notably the provisional formations such as divisions Puthod, Tharreau and Claparede. Massena's and Bernadotte's corps should also probably fight as green. Wagram was a difficult battle for the French, with many senior officers having to expose themselves to enemy fire in order to keep their troops in order.

Ad hoc brigades which are composed of both line and light units should behave the same as any French line regiment, with the ability to send out one skirmish base for the entire brigade. Some French cavalry divisions are so weak, that they must be represented here as brigades. Hence the reason for such formations as "Brigade Lasalle."
